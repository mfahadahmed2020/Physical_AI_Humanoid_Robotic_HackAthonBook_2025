The Distributed Architecture of ROS 2

Unlike ROS 1, which relied on a centralized master node to coordinate all communication, ROS 2 employs a fully distributed peer-to-peer architecture. This fundamental shift eliminates single points of failure and enables more robust, scalable systems.

Peer-to-Peer Discovery

In ROS 2, nodes discover each other automatically through a process called "discovery." When a new node starts, it announces its presence to the network, and existing nodes respond with their own information. 

This discovery mechanism is handled by the DDS layer and happens continuously, allowing nodes to join and leave the system dynamically without disrupting other components.

The discovery process works through multicast communication on the local network. Each node periodically sends announcements containing:

Its unique identifier

Available topics (publishers and subscribers)

Offered services

Advertised actions

Quality of Service requirements

This decentralized approach means that any node can communicate directly with any other node once discovery is complete, without routing through a central coordinator.

Benefits of Distributed Architecture

Fault Tolerance: If any single node crashes, the rest of the system continues operating. This is critical for production robots where uptime and reliability are paramount.

Scalability: Systems can grow from a single computer to multiple machines seamlessly. A humanoid robot might run sensor processing on an edge device, control loops on a real-time processor, and AI inference on a GPU workstation.

Network Partitioning: Robots can operate in environments with intermittent connectivity. If network connections are lost and then restored, nodes automatically rediscover each other and resume communication.

Reduced Latency: Direct peer-to-peer communication eliminates the overhead of routing through a central node, reducing message latency—crucial for real-time control.

Data Distribution Service (DDS)
At the heart of ROS 2's communication architecture is the Data Distribution Service (DDS), an industry-standard middleware for distributed systems. DDS was originally developed for military and aerospace applications where reliability and real-time performance are mission-critical.

What is DDS?

DDS is a publish-subscribe communication protocol that provides:

Discovery of data producers and consumers

Delivery of data with configurable QoS guarantees

Data filtering and content-based routing

Time synchronization across distributed systems

Security through authentication and encryption

ROS 2 abstracts the complexity of DDS, allowing developers to work with familiar ROS concepts while benefiting from DDS's robust underlying implementation.

DDS Implementations

ROS 2 supports multiple DDS implementations, giving users flexibility to choose based on their requirements:

Fast DDS (eProsima): Default implementation, excellent performance, and open-source CycloneDDS (Eclipse): Lightweight, minimal memory footprint, ideal for embedded systems Connext DDS (RTI): 

Enterprise-grade with advanced tooling and support GurumDDS: 

Specialized for real-time systems with deterministic behavior

Users can switch between implementations without changing application code, thanks to ROS 2's abstraction layer. This allows developers to optimize for different deployment scenarios—research prototypes might use Fast DDS for ease of setup, while production systems might use Connext DDS for enterprise support.

The Computational Graph Model

ROS 2 represents a robotic system as a computational graph where nodes are vertices and communication channels are edges. This graph-based model provides a powerful abstraction for designing and debugging complex systems.

Nodes

A node is the fundamental computational unit in ROS 2—a process that performs computation. Examples include:

A camera driver node that publishes image data

A perception node that processes images to detect objects

A planning node that computes navigation paths

A control node that sends commands to motors

Nodes are designed to be modular and focused on a single responsibility. This modularity enables:

Reusability: A well-designed camera driver can be used across different robots

Testability: Individual nodes can be tested in isolation
Parallel Development: Team members can work on different nodes simultaneously

Language Flexibility: Nodes can be written in Python or C++ and communicate seamlessly
Communication Patterns

ROS 2 provides three primary communication patterns, each suited to different use cases:

1. Topics (Publish-Subscribe)

Topics are named communication channels where nodes can publish messages and subscribe to receive them. This is the most common pattern for streaming sensor data.

Example: A LiDAR sensor node publishes laser scan data on the /scan topic, and multiple nodes (localization, obstacle detection, mapping) subscribe to process this data simultaneously.

Characteristics:

One-to-many communication (one publisher, multiple subscribers)
Asynchronous and non-blocking
No acknowledgment of message receipt
Ideal for continuous data streams

2. Services (Request-Response)
Services provide synchronous request-response communication. A client node sends a request to a service server and waits for a response.

Example: A motion planning node calls a service to check if a proposed path collides with obstacles, receiving a boolean response.

Characteristics:

One-to-one communication
Synchronous (client waits for response)
Suitable for occasional transactions
Server may be busy serving other requests

3. Actions (Goal-Oriented)

Actions are designed for long-running tasks that require feedback and the ability to cancel. They extend the service pattern with ongoing status updates.

Example: A robot navigation action where the goal is a target position, feedback includes current progress, and the result indicates success or failure.

Characteristics:

Goal, feedback, and result messages

Can be preempted (cancelled)

Suitable for tasks taking seconds to minutes

Multiple actions can be tracked simultaneously

Quality of Service (QoS) Policies

One of ROS 2's most powerful features is configurable Quality of Service policies that allow fine-grained control over communication behavior. QoS policies address the reality that different types of data have different reliability and timing requirements.

Key QoS Policies

Reliability

Reliable: All messages are guaranteed to arrive (using TCP-like acknowledgments) Best Effort: Messages may be lost (similar to UDP), but with lower overhead

Use Case: Sensor data like laser scans can tolerate occasional dropped messages (Best Effort), while commands to actuators must be delivered reliably (Reliable).

Durability

Volatile: Only messages published after subscription are received 

Transient Local: Late-joining subscribers receive recent historical messages

Use Case: A robot's map should be available to nodes that start after the map is published (Transient Local), while real-time sensor data doesn't need history (Volatile).

History

Keep Last N: Store only the N most recent messages Keep All: Store all messages until delivered

Use Case: High-frequency sensor data uses Keep Last 10 to prevent memory overflow, while important commands might use Keep All.

Lifespan

Specifies how long a message is considered valid.

Use Case: A "robot battery low" message might have a lifespan of 60 seconds—if not processed within that time, it expires and is discarded.

QoS Profiles
ROS 2 provides predefined QoS profiles for common scenarios:

# Sensor data profile: Best effort, volatile, small history

sensor_qos = QoSProfile(
    reliability=QoSReliabilityPolicy.BEST_EFFORT,
    durability=QoSDurabilityPolicy.VOLATILE,
    history=QoSHistoryPolicy.KEEP_LAST,
    depth=10
)

# System default: Reliable, volatile, keep last 10

default_qos = QoSProfile(
    reliability=QoSReliabilityPolicy.RELIABLE,
    durability=QoSDurabilityPolicy.VOLATILE,
    history=QoSHistoryPolicy.KEEP_LAST,
    depth=10
)

# Parameters profile: Reliable, transient local, keep all

parameter_qos = QoSProfile(
    reliability=QoSReliabilityPolicy.RELIABLE,
    durability=QoSDurabilityPolicy.TRANSIENT_LOCAL,
    history=QoSHistoryPolicy.KEEP_ALL
)
Understanding and correctly applying QoS policies is essential for building robust, performant robotic systems. Mismatched QoS between publishers and subscribers can lead to no communication occurring—a common source of confusion for ROS 2 beginners.

Security Architecture

ROS 2 includes security features built on DDS Security, providing authentication, access control, and encryption.

SROS 2 (Secure ROS 2)

SROS 2 enables:

Authentication: Verify the identity of nodes using X.509 certificates

Access Control: Define which nodes can publish/subscribe to specific topics

Encryption: Protect data in transit using AES encryption
While security is optional and often disabled for development, it becomes critical for production deployments, especially for robots operating in public spaces or handling sensitive data.

Execution Management

ROS 2 uses executors to manage how callbacks (message handlers, timer callbacks, service responses) are executed:

Single-Threaded Executor: All callbacks execute sequentially on one thread (default, simple to reason about)

Multi-Threaded Executor: Callbacks execute in parallel on multiple threads (better performance, requires thread-safe code)

StaticSingleThreadedExecutor: Optimized for real-time performance with pre-allocated memory

Choosing the right executor depends on your performance requirements and whether your callback functions are thread-safe.

Lifecycle Management

ROS 2 introduces managed nodes with explicit lifecycle states (Unconfigured, Inactive, Active, Finalized). This enables controlled startup and shutdown sequences—crucial for robots with complex initialization procedures.

For example, a camera node might:

Configure: Load parameters and allocate resources

Activate: Start capturing images

Deactivate: Stop capture but keep resources allocated

Cleanup: Release resources and prepare for shutdown
