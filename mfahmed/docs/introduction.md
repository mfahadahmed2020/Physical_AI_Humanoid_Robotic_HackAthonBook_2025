# Introduction to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook. This comprehensive guide will take you from foundational concepts to advanced humanoid control systems using ROS 2, Gazebo, Unity, NVIDIA Isaac, and Vision-Language-Action systems.

## What is Physical AI?

Physical AI refers to the field of artificial intelligence that focuses on embodied intelligence - the idea that intelligence emerges from the interaction between an agent and its physical environment. Unlike traditional AI that operates on abstract data, Physical AI systems must navigate, manipulate, and understand the physical world.
