## Prompt

/sp.constitution create principles for physical Ai & Humanoid Robotics course book. Focus on Embodied intelligence, high-fidelity simulation workflows, humanoid control systems, ROS2 reliability, and safety standards.

## Response snapshot

Created a comprehensive constitution for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Course with six core principles:

1. Embodied Intelligence (NON-NEGOTIABLE) - Emphasizing the integration of perception, cognition, and action as the foundation of all robotics implementations
2. High-Fidelity Simulation Workflows - Mandating simulation-first development with realistic physics environments
3. Humanoid Control Systems Architecture - Specifying hierarchical control architectures with modular designs
4. ROS2 Reliability Standards - Ensuring robust communication layers and fault tolerance in systems
5. Comprehensive Safety Protocols - Prioritizing safety with multiple safety layers and human oversight
6. Model-Based Design and Verification - Requiring mathematical modeling and verification of all systems

The constitution also includes additional technical constraints, development workflow standards, and governance guidelines specific to robotics education.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Successfully created comprehensive constitution for Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics course incorporating all requested principles
- 🧪 Tests: none
- 📁 Files: Updated .specify/memory/constitution.md with new robotics-focused principles
- 🔁 Next prompts: Could proceed to create specific feature specifications based on this constitution
- 🧠 Reflection: The new constitution establishes strong foundations for a robotics-focused curriculum emphasizing safety, simulation-based development, and model-based design.
