## Prompt

/sp.specify Create a textbook that teaches Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics from foundation to Advanced Humanoid Control Using ROS 2, Gazebo, Unity, NVIDIA Isaac, and Vision-Language-Action system.

## Response snapshot

Created a comprehensive feature specification for a Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook with four user stories:

1. Foundation Robotics Education (P1) - Teaching fundamental principles of embodied intelligence
2. Simulation-Based Learning (P2) - High-fidelity simulation workflows using Gazebo, Unity, NVIDIA Isaac
3. Advanced Humanoid Control (P3) - ROS 2 and vision-language-action systems
4. Integrated Practical Application (P4) - Complete course curriculum framework

The specification includes 10 functional requirements, 4 success criteria with measurable outcomes, and addresses key entities and edge cases. A quality checklist was also created.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Successfully created comprehensive feature specification for robotics textbook with clear user scenarios and measurable outcomes
- 🧪 Tests: none
- 📁 Files: Created spec.md and requirements checklist in specs/001-create-robotics-textbook/
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready to proceed with /sp.plan to create implementation plan
- 🧠 Reflection: The specification clearly defines the textbook's scope from foundational concepts to advanced implementations with measurable success criteria.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: none
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): not applicable
- Prompt variant (if applicable): not applicable
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): not applicable
